# Application Layer
## About
In this directory you'll find a few challenges I've done for the so called "Application layer" of my study. I'll mainly consist of Python scripts. Feel free to submit improvements/feedback or even try out the code!
## File Structure
The main scrips will namely be challenges (which can be found in the same directory), while the training course directory are things from the training course at Cisco's NetAcad that I found particularly interesting! I've added a research folder too, where I'll upload things or scripts that helped me along the way.
