# Application Layer
## About
In this directory you'll find a few challenges I've done for the so called "Application layer" of my study. I'll mainly consist of Python scripts. Feel free to submit improvements/feedback or even try out the code!
## File Structure
The main scrips will namely be challenges, while the training course directory are things from the training course at Cisco's NetAcad that I found particularly interesting!
